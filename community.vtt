1
00:00:14.275 --> 00:00:15.446
Good morning.

2
00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.039
How do we turn this off? Mother, you think

3
00:00:22.003 --> 00:00:24.274
How do we turn this off?

4
00:00:24.275 --> 00:00:26.765
Oh, thank you, thank you so much.

5
00:00:26.767 --> 00:00:28.767
- uh, good morning.

6
00:00:28.834 --> 00:00:30.834
Many of you

7
00:00:30.901 --> 00:00:32.601
Your first week here

8
00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:35.968
And as your dean,

9
00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:39.501
Share a few thoughts

1
00:00:39.567 --> 00:00:41.334
What is community college?

1
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.134
Well, you've heard

1
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.933
You've heard it's

1
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.034
For remedial teens,

1
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.351
Middle-age divorcees,

1
00:00:52.718 --> 00:00:54.651
And old people keeping

1
00:00:54.718 --> 00:00:57.517
As they circle

1
00:00:57.584 --> 00:00:59.718
That's what you heard.

1
00:00:59.783 --> 00:01:02.551
However, i wish you luck!

1
00:01:06.517 --> 00:01:09.084
Okay, you know--

2
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.551
Okay, there's more

2
00:01:10.618 --> 00:01:11.718
There's actually a middle card

2
00:01:11.783 --> 00:01:13.783
Can we all look around our

2
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.351
'cause i really wanted to--

2
00:01:15.417 --> 00:01:16.218
- i'm only half-arabic,

2
00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:17.884
My dad is palestinian.

2
00:01:17.951 --> 00:01:19.450
He's not a threat to national

2
00:01:19.517 --> 00:01:20.717
A lot of people want to know

2
00:01:20.784 --> 00:01:21.851
Because he has

2
00:01:21.917 --> 00:01:22.917
But not, like,

3
00:01:22.984 --> 00:01:24.284
Just angry at my mom

3
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.584
Although she did leave

3
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.117
And he was angry

3
00:01:27.184 --> 00:01:28.884
My name's abed,

3
00:01:28.951 --> 00:01:32.151
- abed, nice to know you and

3
00:01:32.218 --> 00:01:33.851
Now about that question

3
00:01:33.917 --> 00:01:35.318
- oh, uh...

3
00:01:35.383 --> 00:01:37.051
5 after 11:00

3
00:01:37.117 --> 00:01:38.450
- abed?

3
00:01:38.517 --> 00:01:40.750
- what's the deal with

4
00:01:40.817 --> 00:01:42.584
I can't find a road

4
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:43.951
- well, i only talked

4
00:01:44.017 --> 00:01:45.984
While she was borrowing

4
00:01:46.051 --> 00:01:47.750
Her name is britta, she's 28,

4
00:01:47.817 --> 00:01:48.984
She has two older brothers

4
00:01:49.051 --> 00:01:50.084
Works with children

4
00:01:50.151 --> 00:01:51.251
I might want to look up.

4
00:01:51.318 --> 00:01:52.483
Oh, and she thinks

4
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:53.750
Tomorrow's test,

4
00:01:53.817 --> 00:01:56.251
So she's sorry

5
00:01:56.318 --> 00:01:57.483
- holy crap.

5
00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:58.211
Abed...

5
00:01:58.718 --> 00:02:01.784
I see your value now.

5
00:02:02.351 --> 00:02:04.517
- that's the nicest thing

5
00:02:07.356 --> 00:02:08.706
Absolutely not.

5
00:02:10.035 --> 00:02:13.429
If these guys knew you like I did

5
00:02:13.584 --> 00:02:14.817
- jeff winger!

5
00:02:14.884 --> 00:02:16.684
Genius at law.

5
00:02:16.751 --> 00:02:20.284
- you got to stop saying that.

5
00:02:20.285 --> 00:02:22.885
I still cannot figure out how you

6
00:02:22.886 --> 00:02:24.936
September the 11th with my DUI,

6
00:02:24.937 --> 00:02:26.737
that alone, why that helped.

6
00:02:26.738 --> 00:02:29.038
Well, 2002 was a simple time.

6
00:02:29.025 --> 00:02:31.316
So what is my lawyer

6
00:02:31.845 --> 00:02:33.245
- i'm a student.

6
00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:36.430
- well, that cannot be

6
00:02:36.431 --> 00:02:38.403
- uh, i am in a bit

6
00:02:38.404 --> 00:02:41.205
The state bar has

6
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.875
They found out my college degree

6
00:02:44.876 --> 00:02:46.793
- i thought you had a bachelor's

7
00:02:46.794 --> 00:02:49.087
- now i have to get one

7
00:02:49.088 --> 00:02:51.061
- and it can't be

7
00:02:51.062 --> 00:02:52.833
- well, you've picked

7
00:02:52.834 --> 00:02:56.140
- yes, and i'm hoping

7
00:02:56.266 --> 00:02:57.861
Will yield certain advantages.

7
00:02:57.862 --> 00:02:59.484
You know, academic guidance...

7
00:02:59.485 --> 00:03:00.872
- moral support,

7
00:03:00.873 --> 00:03:03.600
Every answer

7
00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:05.678
For every one of the classes

7
00:03:05.713 --> 00:03:08.243
Here's my schedule.

8
00:03:08.244 --> 00:03:12.001
You have insulted the integrity

8
00:03:12.921 --> 00:03:14.638
Waster!

8
00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:17.281
Not a bathroom.

8
00:03:17.282 --> 00:03:20.727
did seem less into integrity

8
00:03:20.728 --> 00:03:24.487
12 of yours peers that when you made

8
00:03:24.488 --> 00:03:27.345
And tried to order chalupas

8
00:03:27.346 --> 00:03:29.283
That your only real crime

8
00:03:29.284 --> 00:03:32.054
Well, I do love America, I do love it,

8
00:03:33.276 --> 00:03:35.382
I love chalupas.

8
00:03:35.577 --> 00:03:36.742
But...

9
00:03:36.916 --> 00:03:38.538
- i'll look into it.

9
00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:40.787
Duncan, you are a good man.

9
00:03:41.186 --> 00:03:45.032
- jeff, are you familiar with the adage,

9
00:03:45.033 --> 00:03:46.110
No...

9
00:03:46.111 --> 00:03:49.400
and if i wanted to learn something,

9
00:03:54.733 --> 00:03:57.225
Transcripted on Addic7ed by honeybunny and VeRdiKT

9
00:03:57.358 --> 00:04:00.837
9
00:04:25.747 --> 00:04:27.938
- whoa. 

1
00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:31.233
I just wanted to let you know

1
00:04:33.342 --> 00:04:37.310
the guy who's playing bejeweled

1
00:04:37.311 --> 00:04:38.819
Um, can i sign up twice?

1
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.707
- i'm taking the class as an easy credit.

1
00:04:42.708 --> 00:04:45.522
- Board certified.

1
00:04:45.847 --> 00:04:50.331
- [speaking spanish]

1
00:04:52.607 --> 00:04:56.107
- i really need help with spanish.

1
00:04:56.108 --> 00:04:57.108
Or "Jefe".

1
00:04:57.109 --> 00:04:57.975
Boss.

1
00:04:57.976 --> 00:05:00.956
- We meet at the library at 4:00.

1
00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:04.445
You gonna be there?

1
00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:07.189
Un po' di piu'.

1
00:05:07.342 --> 00:05:09.192
That means "See you there".

1
00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:13.042
Shouldn't be too hard to fake

1
00:05:13.609 --> 00:05:15.715
Oh, geez, I'm sorry... I...

1
00:05:15.908 --> 00:05:19.227
I was raised on TV and I was conditioned

1
00:05:19.228 --> 00:05:22.128
Black woman over 50 is a cosmic mentor..

1
00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:25.818
Were you conditioned to pay

1
00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:27.719
Yes, I'm so sorry.

1
00:05:27.978 --> 00:05:29.209
It's Seinfeld.

1
00:05:31.821 --> 00:05:34.292
Group Study Room

1
00:05:34.738 --> 00:05:35.984
Bienvenido.

1
00:05:36.446 --> 00:05:37.840
Bienvenuto!

1
00:05:38.072 --> 00:05:39.559
Hey, all right,

1
00:05:40.187 --> 00:05:42.427
- I got the whole table. Welcome.

1
00:05:42.428 --> 00:05:44.704
- We have the whole room.

1
00:05:45.901 --> 00:05:48.111
contact sheet.

1
00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.526
Man.

1
00:05:51.445 --> 00:05:53.308
Rest of the group

1
00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:55.088
But you and i can

1
00:05:57.917 --> 00:05:59.623
- yeah, i like big talk.

1
00:05:59.624 --> 00:06:02.786
- that's not small talk?

1
00:06:03.311 --> 00:06:04.982
- all right, you want

1
00:06:04.983 --> 00:06:07.700
I dropped out of high-school because

1
00:06:07.735 --> 00:06:09.297
I thought for some reason 

1
00:06:09.298 --> 00:06:11.615
You'd be surprised what gets back

1
00:06:11.774 --> 00:06:14.024
I joined the peace corp.

1
00:06:14.146 --> 00:06:15.695
I did a little foot modelling,

1
00:06:15.696 --> 00:06:17.869
I got tear gased in a World Trade Rally...

1
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.089
Marry me.

1
00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.882
And I think, Jeff, my deal is above all else,

1
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.052
You tell me the truth,

1
00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:29.649
You lie to me, i will never talk to you again.

1
00:06:29.857 --> 00:06:31.959
- ah, that's a good deal.

1
00:06:32.807 --> 00:06:36.094
- uh, i would have to go--

1
00:06:36.664 --> 00:06:37.820
um, honesty,

1
00:06:38.008 --> 00:06:39.131
Because...

1
00:06:39.288 --> 00:06:42.434
I would say anything

1
00:06:42.435 --> 00:06:44.414
And i want you

1
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:47.750
- wow.

1
00:06:48.214 --> 00:06:50.014
All right,

1
00:06:50.098 --> 00:06:52.927
- really? Wow. you're easy.

1
00:06:53.322 --> 00:06:55.564
Abed in the house!

1
00:06:58.418 --> 00:07:00.808
- why?

1
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.805
- oh, i can't think

1
00:07:03.806 --> 00:07:05.842
- cool.

1
00:07:05.877 --> 00:07:08.212
Oh, hey, here. Put your contact info down

1
00:07:08.213 --> 00:07:10.680
That's right.

1
00:07:10.715 --> 00:07:12.217
Cool, cool, cool.

1
00:07:13.507 --> 00:07:15.237
<i>hey, this is kind of like

1
00:07:15.238 --> 00:07:16.868
- we are in a library.

1
00:07:16.869 --> 00:07:19.818
i'm sure we've each got an issue balled up inside of us 

1
00:07:19.819 --> 00:07:22.393
- do you have something

1
00:07:22.762 --> 00:07:25.338
- well, i got a little doozy

1
00:07:28.082 --> 00:07:29.417
Oh.

1
00:07:29.786 --> 00:07:32.204
- Let's give this bad boy a read.

1
00:07:32.205 --> 00:07:34.963
- I've never got one of these

1
00:07:34.964 --> 00:07:37.953
- it's probably just for your eyes.

1
00:07:39.375 --> 00:07:40.889
"say you have to pee."

1
00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:42.158
- that is weird.

1
00:07:42.159 --> 00:07:44.540
- "say you have to pee. I need to talk to you."

1
00:07:44.541 --> 00:07:47.147
- no. 

1
00:07:47.148 --> 00:07:49.051
- that's so weird.

1
00:07:51.997 --> 00:07:53.766
- no, it's just someone

1
00:07:53.767 --> 00:07:56.206
With a misguided grasp

1
00:07:56.384 --> 00:07:59.402
I just need five minutes, you guys,

1
00:07:59.581 --> 00:08:01.345
all the verbs...in spanish.

1
00:08:01.984 --> 00:08:03.176
- Abed...

1
00:08:03.177 --> 00:08:04.537
What's your read on that guy?

1
00:08:05.725 --> 00:08:07.325
You look like Elisabeth Shue.

1
00:08:09.666 --> 00:08:13.342
Act natural, pretend you are watching

1
00:08:13.343 --> 00:08:15.320
I couldn't stop watching them.

1
00:08:15.321 --> 00:08:19.313
There's a guy going for the track, that's older

1
00:08:20.432 --> 00:08:21.932
He's kinda cracking.

1
00:08:22.416 --> 00:08:26.456
- suppose i was to say to you

1
00:08:26.457 --> 00:08:29.297
- i would say, "go for that,"

1
00:08:29.298 --> 00:08:32.470
- i'm asking you if you know the difference

1
00:08:33.222 --> 00:08:36.085
- i discovered at a very early age

1
00:08:36.086 --> 00:08:38.163
I could make anything

1
00:08:38.164 --> 00:08:41.041
So either i'm god

1
00:08:41.076 --> 00:08:42.776
And in either case,

1
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:46.194
- oh, interesting. It's just the average person has

1
00:08:46.195 --> 00:08:48.105
"booyah,"

1
00:08:48.106 --> 00:08:50.667
- duncan, you don't have to play shrink 

1
00:08:50.668 --> 00:08:52.423
I accept.

1
00:08:52.424 --> 00:08:54.907
Are you trying to use reverse psychology

2
00:08:54.908 --> 00:08:58.187
No, I'm just using regular psychology

2
00:08:58.188 --> 00:09:00.115
- i'm a professor.

2
00:09:00.116 --> 00:09:03.417
- a six-year-old girl could talk to you that way.

2
00:09:03.452 --> 00:09:06.840
- No, because you're a five-year-old girl

2
00:09:06.841 --> 00:09:08.757
- fine! i'll do it!

2
00:09:08.758 --> 00:09:10.458
- yeah, pleasure.

2
00:09:10.586 --> 00:09:11.586
Bye!

2
00:09:11.734 --> 00:09:13.108
Yes!

2
00:09:13.436 --> 00:09:15.337
Why am i still shouting?

2
00:09:15.338 --> 00:09:16.910
I'm drawing attention

2
00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:20.195
- you guys aren't gonna believe this,

2
00:09:21.411 --> 00:09:22.556
Is here.

2
00:09:22.728 --> 00:09:25.158
- are you

2
00:09:25.159 --> 00:09:26.953
- that means you do my homework,

2
00:09:26.954 --> 00:09:29.020
- i need to call my babysitter

2
00:09:29.021 --> 00:09:30.799
- what board certifies

2
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.017
- where's britta?

2
00:09:32.018 --> 00:09:34.530
But i invited more people

2
00:09:34.531 --> 00:09:36.228
- it's the coolest.

2
00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:39.788
I'm gonna go

2
00:09:39.823 --> 00:09:42.290
And bring my jacket,

2
00:09:42.325 --> 00:09:44.733
wallet,

2
00:09:47.334 --> 00:09:48.471
- should we go with him?

2
00:09:48.472 --> 00:09:50.423
- i'm leaving my homework with

2
00:09:50.424 --> 00:09:52.374
- that's borderline racist,

2
00:09:56.351 --> 00:09:58.029
- and busted.

2
00:09:58.746 --> 00:10:01.425
- uh, listen.

2
00:10:02.611 --> 00:10:05.099
- yeah, but they're filtered,

2
00:10:05.519 --> 00:10:08.224
- you ready to get started?

2
00:10:08.225 --> 00:10:11.553
- yeah, not mine, actually.

2
00:10:11.554 --> 00:10:13.431
And i was trained never

2
00:10:13.432 --> 00:10:16.075
But i think that group

2
00:10:17.324 --> 00:10:19.719
- so why don't you and i

2
00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.423
- dinner?

2
00:10:21.424 --> 00:10:23.959
- i think, actually,

2
00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.379
And study first

2
00:10:28.022 --> 00:10:31.839
And if they really prove

2
00:10:33.945 --> 00:10:35.095
- oh...they will be...

2
00:10:35.643 --> 00:10:36.793
untutorable.

2
00:10:43.189 --> 00:10:45.267
- all right.

2
00:10:45.542 --> 00:10:47.063
Look at this crew.

2
00:10:47.098 --> 00:10:49.815
All ready to study all night.

2
00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:51.142
- well, i can stay

2
00:10:51.143 --> 00:10:53.618
- but who studies

2
00:10:53.896 --> 00:10:55.146
My name is jeff.

2
00:10:55.395 --> 00:10:56.635
- jeff, it's a pleasure.

2
00:10:56.765 --> 00:10:58.600
My name is pierce hawthorne

2
00:10:58.601 --> 00:11:02.047
That is hawthorne as in hawthorne wipes,

2
00:11:02.326 --> 00:11:03.399
- i was just going to ask.

2
00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.982
- i'm also a toast master, so perhaps

2
00:11:07.615 --> 00:11:09.919
- britta.

2
00:11:09.954 --> 00:11:11.267
Is that inappropriate?

2
00:11:11.268 --> 00:11:13.381
- roy. roy the wonder boy.

2
00:11:13.416 --> 00:11:15.457
- little princess elizabeth.

2
00:11:15.727 --> 00:11:18.803
- and finally, this beautiful

2
00:11:19.496 --> 00:11:20.712
- is that even close?

2
00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:23.758
- i'd like to know why i had to find out

2
00:11:23.759 --> 00:11:26.143
- <i>- this is getting way more like breakfast club now.</i>

2
00:11:26.144 --> 00:11:27.571
- okay, um, maybe we should

2
00:11:27.572 --> 00:11:30.140
- you know, i've been a part

2
00:11:30.141 --> 00:11:32.141
because

2
00:11:32.309 --> 00:11:35.061
Shouldn't we address Annie's concern? 

2
00:11:35.062 --> 00:11:36.832
- well, annie, sweetie,

2
00:11:36.833 --> 00:11:39.884
- We just didn't think about...

2
00:11:40.137 --> 00:11:42.073
Being younger does

2
00:11:42.074 --> 00:11:45.621
If anything, your age indicates

2
00:11:45.794 --> 00:11:47.782
- shirley has a response to that.

2
00:11:47.783 --> 00:11:50.589
- you should. it looks like you do.

2
00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:52.246
- okay, okay.

2
00:11:52.387 --> 00:11:55.472
I'm sure i've made

2
00:11:55.628 --> 00:11:58.299
And maybe annie's decisions

2
00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.870
But i think she needs to decide

2
00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:04.271
Or an adult, because children get pity

2
00:12:04.272 --> 00:12:06.998
But not respect. And adults, 

2
00:12:06.999 --> 00:12:09.636
But they also get the back of they head grabbed 

2
00:12:09.637 --> 00:12:10.741
- okay.

2
00:12:10.776 --> 00:12:14.080
Why don't we try learning

2
00:12:14.081 --> 00:12:16.081
- what are you doing?

2
00:12:16.082 --> 00:12:18.161
- Let's discuss this creepiness.

2
00:12:18.162 --> 00:12:20.089
- what are you doing?

2
00:12:20.261 --> 00:12:24.014
Are you unaware that shirley

2
00:12:25.268 --> 00:12:26.356
what advances?

2
00:12:26.357 --> 00:12:29.665
- you have been sexually harassing me

2
00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:31.316
- sexually harassing?

2
00:12:31.981 --> 00:12:33.960
what? That makes no sense to me.

2
00:12:33.995 --> 00:12:37.114
Why would i harass somebody

2
00:12:37.115 --> 00:12:40.015
- saying she turns you on

2
00:12:40.702 --> 00:12:41.859
- hey.

2
00:12:42.792 --> 00:12:45.790
I am a prominent business leader

2
00:12:45.791 --> 00:12:49.775
And i will not take courting advice

2
00:12:49.776 --> 00:12:53.196
well, this teenage boy 

2
00:12:53.197 --> 00:12:56.573
- you're not prom king anymore, troy.

2
00:12:56.574 --> 00:12:58.199
- how'd you know

2
00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:02.569
- because you're still wearing

2
00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:05.289
And more importantly, I sat behind you

2
00:13:06.018 --> 00:13:08.821
Wait, you're that girl that got hooked on pills

2
00:13:08.822 --> 00:13:10.611
You're little Annie "Adderall".

3
00:13:10.612 --> 00:13:13.949
Yes, and you are a stupid jock

3
00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:16.100
by dislocating both shoulders

3
00:13:16.101 --> 00:13:18.228
Keg flip.

3
00:13:18.229 --> 00:13:21.425
You don't know--

3
00:13:26.597 --> 00:13:28.601
You know what I got

3
00:13:29.684 --> 00:13:32.491
It was a banner year

3
00:13:32.492 --> 00:13:34.832
I got a carton

3
00:13:34.833 --> 00:13:38.583
The old man grabbed me, he said,

3
00:13:39.833 --> 00:13:42.047
"No, dad!

3
00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.823
Well, uh...

3
00:13:47.062 --> 00:13:49.970
<i>That actually was from

3
00:13:51.068 --> 00:13:53.040
Nobody puts baby

3
00:13:53.897 --> 00:13:55.462
<i>Dirty Dancing.</i>

3
00:13:55.463 --> 00:13:57.180
Hello.

3
00:13:57.181 --> 00:13:59.276
<i>Come to the parking lot now.</i>

3
00:13:59.403 --> 00:14:00.990
What's wrong

3
00:14:00.991 --> 00:14:02.484
I'm disguising it.

3
00:14:04.396 --> 00:14:05.396
Uh, I'll be right back.

3
00:14:05.397 --> 00:14:08.967
But while I'm gone, you guys need

3
00:14:08.968 --> 00:14:10.968
No stone unturned.

3
00:14:11.133 --> 00:14:12.817
- Go!

3
00:14:12.818 --> 00:14:16.105
- I can't feel my...

3
00:14:25.532 --> 00:14:29.166
Act as if either you have just finished

3
00:14:30.737 --> 00:14:34.349
Every answer to every test

3
00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:36.427
I knew you could

3
00:14:36.428 --> 00:14:38.273
Whoa there, grabby-grabby.

3
00:14:38.852 --> 00:14:42.132
- What do I get?

3
00:14:42.133 --> 00:14:45.049
Even, fairness, right, wrong.

3
00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:47.350
- Booyah, booyah.

3
00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:50.760
- Your Lexus.

3
00:14:50.761 --> 00:14:53.143
Will it be just

3
00:14:53.144 --> 00:14:56.426
Won't you be taking the easy way out

3
00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.349
I want payment in advance.

3
00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:00.950
I want leather seats

3
00:15:00.951 --> 00:15:04.890
You know, bluffs this weak are how

3
00:15:04.891 --> 00:15:07.175
Have a nice disbarment

3
00:15:08.308 --> 00:15:11.173
- What am I supposed to drive?

3
00:15:11.174 --> 00:15:14.490
Yeah, so is wiping your butt with a leaf,

3
00:15:20.804 --> 00:15:22.106
A golf kart!

3
00:15:27.997 --> 00:15:31.312
- It is a disaster in there.

3
00:15:31.716 --> 00:15:34.318
- You like Thai food? I love Thai food.

3
00:15:34.319 --> 00:15:35.874
so... this

3
00:15:35.875 --> 00:15:38.979
You put human beings

3
00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.592
for a shot

3
00:15:40.593 --> 00:15:43.287
Why can't you see that

3
00:15:44.008 --> 00:15:46.824
Ok, ok. I'm sorry.

3
00:15:47.218 --> 00:15:49.775
I did a little bit of lying 

3
00:15:49.925 --> 00:15:52.833
But how was I suppose to know

3
00:15:52.834 --> 00:15:54.643
I mean, you look like Elisabeth Shue.

3
00:15:54.644 --> 00:15:56.281
- You're unbelievable.

3
00:15:56.282 --> 00:16:00.342
Oh, maybe one decent thing could be

3
00:16:00.343 --> 00:16:03.459
<i>Okay, I am the Barack Obama

3
00:16:03.755 --> 00:16:06.655
Okay, if i do that,

3
00:16:09.199 --> 00:16:10.723
Yeah, fine, whatever.

3
00:16:10.724 --> 00:16:15.227
As if there's a dinner on Earth that could

3
00:16:15.228 --> 00:16:18.326
Oh, you're gonna eat those words

3
00:16:24.441 --> 00:16:26.344
All right, everybody!

3
00:16:26.797 --> 00:16:28.897
I want to say something.

3
00:16:29.508 --> 00:16:32.134
You don't have to yell.

3
00:16:34.529 --> 00:16:36.693
You know what makes humans

3
00:16:36.694 --> 00:16:37.865
Feet.

3
00:16:38.111 --> 00:16:40.166
No, no, no, come on.

3
00:16:40.167 --> 00:16:43.995
We're the only species on Earth

3
00:16:44.604 --> 00:16:47.518
Sharks don't even observe

3
00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:51.278
For the same reason I can pick up this pencil,

3
00:16:51.279 --> 00:16:52.830
and go like this.

3
00:16:53.123 --> 00:16:56.573
And part of you dies just

3
00:16:56.739 --> 00:16:59.647
because people can connect

3
00:16:59.879 --> 00:17:01.470
We can sympathize

3
00:17:01.471 --> 00:17:05.562
We can forgive a shark. And we can give

3
00:17:05.563 --> 00:17:06.666
- Big mistake.

3
00:17:06.667 --> 00:17:11.265
People can find the good

3
00:17:11.513 --> 00:17:14.628
Look at me. It's clear to

3
00:17:14.914 --> 00:17:17.648
but I can never admit that,

3
00:17:17.649 --> 00:17:20.606
But what I can do is see

3
00:17:20.607 --> 00:17:21.707
She's driven.

3
00:17:21.739 --> 00:17:25.107
We need driven people or the lights go out

3
00:17:25.108 --> 00:17:27.643
And Pierce.

3
00:17:27.644 --> 00:17:29.904
This guy has

3
00:17:29.905 --> 00:17:32.591
- The Dalai Lama and I--

3
00:17:32.592 --> 00:17:33.740
We wouldn't regret it.

3
00:17:33.741 --> 00:17:34.833
And Shirley.

3
00:17:35.078 --> 00:17:37.043
Shirley has earned

3
00:17:37.044 --> 00:17:40.166
Not as a wife, not as a mother,

3
00:17:40.391 --> 00:17:42.870
And don't test her on that,

3
00:17:42.871 --> 00:17:44.915
was way too specific

3
00:17:44.916 --> 00:17:45.991
And Troy.

3
00:17:46.149 --> 00:17:48.744
Who cares if Troy

3
00:17:48.745 --> 00:17:49.995
Maybe he is.

3
00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:53.017
You think astronauts go to the moon

3
00:17:53.018 --> 00:17:56.051
They're trying to impress

3
00:17:56.052 --> 00:17:57.227
And Abed.

3
00:17:57.518 --> 00:17:59.138
Abed's a shaman.

3
00:17:59.139 --> 00:18:02.685
You ask him to pass the salt,

3
00:18:02.693 --> 00:18:05.288
because you know what?

3
00:18:05.289 --> 00:18:06.639
Abed is better.

3
00:18:06.645 --> 00:18:09.129
You are all better

3
00:18:09.305 --> 00:18:12.214
You are just designed not to believe it

3
00:18:12.356 --> 00:18:13.425
Soup?

4
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.024
I want you to look

4
00:18:17.172 --> 00:18:19.782
Sorry. Look at the person

4
00:18:19.783 --> 00:18:21.087
Look at her?

4
00:18:21.088 --> 00:18:22.445
- This?

4
00:18:22.446 --> 00:18:25.228
I want you to extend

4
00:18:25.555 --> 00:18:29.405
the same compassion that you extend

4
00:18:29.498 --> 00:18:31.395
I want you to say

4
00:18:31.396 --> 00:18:32.546
"I forgive you."

4
00:18:33.681 --> 00:18:35.484
- I forgive you.

4
00:18:35.714 --> 00:18:37.638
- I forgive you.

4
00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:39.872
Pierce, I'd like you to say,

4
00:18:40.145 --> 00:18:41.395
He didn't say it?

4
00:18:41.856 --> 00:18:42.959
I forgive you.

4
00:18:43.149 --> 00:18:45.249
You've just stopped being

4
00:18:45.576 --> 00:18:47.125
You have become something...

4
00:18:47.186 --> 00:18:48.536
unstoppable.

4
00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.973
I hereby pronounce you...

4
00:18:51.241 --> 00:18:52.534
a community.

4
00:18:53.021 --> 00:18:54.221
Oh, that's nice.

4
00:18:54.603 --> 00:18:55.703
I like that.

4
00:18:58.903 --> 00:19:00.657
This isn't like

4
00:19:00.658 --> 00:19:02.959
Now it's like Stripes or Meatballs.

4
00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.960
I agree with Abed that tonight

4
00:19:06.656 --> 00:19:08.122
And now,

4
00:19:08.123 --> 00:19:10.175
I have a dinner engagement

4
00:19:10.745 --> 00:19:11.810
Britta?

4
00:19:12.038 --> 00:19:13.279
I lied.

4
00:19:14.047 --> 00:19:15.844
Thanks for calming

4
00:19:15.845 --> 00:19:18.622
but since you're not a Spanish tutor,

4
00:19:18.623 --> 00:19:21.864
who purposely upset everyone

4
00:19:21.865 --> 00:19:25.569
I'd appreciate it if you left

4
00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:26.964
Everybody ready?

4
00:19:28.382 --> 00:19:29.509
Fine.

4
00:19:30.693 --> 00:19:32.543
And I'm happy to report

4
00:19:32.683 --> 00:19:35.557
that one of the benefits

4
00:19:35.726 --> 00:19:38.651
is having all the answers

4
00:19:38.859 --> 00:19:41.945
And I'm happy to share them with anyone

4
00:19:41.946 --> 00:19:43.801
than they've wasted mine.

4
00:19:43.802 --> 00:19:48.082
Uh, Jeff, if you have all the answers,

4
00:19:48.083 --> 00:19:50.035
I don't have a study group, Pierce.

4
00:19:50.036 --> 00:19:52.655
- What about the "Look Left" speech?

4
00:19:52.656 --> 00:19:56.339
I make things up,

4
00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:58.555
to do it before I came

4
00:19:58.556 --> 00:19:59.994
I was a lawyer.

4
00:20:00.291 --> 00:20:02.058
- Oh, God.

4
00:20:02.998 --> 00:20:06.960
You know, I thought you were like Bill Murray in any of

4
00:20:06.961 --> 00:20:08.026
- Yeah?

4
00:20:08.027 --> 00:20:09.440
Well, you have Asperger's.

4
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:12.100
What did he say?

4
00:20:13.187 --> 00:20:14.187
"Ass-burger".

4
00:20:14.188 --> 00:20:16.383
- It's a serious disorder.

4
00:20:16.384 --> 00:20:18.752
If it's so serious,

4
00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:23.194
- "Ass-burger".

4
00:20:37.111 --> 00:20:38.612
# #

4
00:20:46.287 --> 00:20:49.467
Jeffrey, before you say anything, you may

4
00:20:49.468 --> 00:20:52.282
- An excuse to punch a hippy?

4
00:20:52.283 --> 00:20:55.120
An important lesson,

4
00:20:55.474 --> 00:20:59.613
the tools you acquired to survive out there

4
00:20:59.614 --> 00:21:03.248
What you have, my friend,

4
00:21:03.249 --> 00:21:06.040
Why are people trying 

4
00:21:06.074 --> 00:21:09.027
At a school that has

4
00:21:09.324 --> 00:21:12.552
- Give me the keys.

4
00:21:12.553 --> 00:21:14.304
Don't hit me.

4
00:21:14.464 --> 00:21:15.902
Jeffrey, Jeffrey!

4
00:21:16.259 --> 00:21:17.709
Are we cool?

4
00:21:18.168 --> 00:21:19.358
Are we cool?

4
00:21:21.203 --> 00:21:22.360
We're cool.

4
00:21:24.352 --> 00:21:25.902
I like you, Jeffrey.

4
00:21:27.893 --> 00:21:30.393
You remind me of myself

4
00:21:31.391 --> 00:21:32.541
I deserve that.

4
00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:34.227
You know,

4
00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.265
I've been divorced

4
00:21:36.836 --> 00:21:38.012
seven times.

4
00:21:39.454 --> 00:21:41.441
Sometimes, I think I'm doing

4
00:21:47.311 --> 00:21:49.311
You keep getting married.

4
00:21:50.076 --> 00:21:51.844
I never looked at it

4
00:21:55.142 --> 00:21:57.158
Shouldn't you guys

4
00:21:57.159 --> 00:21:59.874
Yeah, things got kind

4
00:22:00.004 --> 00:22:01.517
Let me ask you something.

4
00:22:01.872 --> 00:22:04.888
People becloud me for wearing this jacket

4
00:22:05.377 --> 00:22:07.091
If I take it off to make them happy,

4
00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:09.170
That just makes me weak, right?

4
00:22:09.326 --> 00:22:10.455
Listen,

4
00:22:10.611 --> 00:22:11.954
it doesn't matter.

4
00:22:11.955 --> 00:22:14.959
You lose the jacket to please them,

4
00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:16.480
Either way

4
00:22:16.481 --> 00:22:17.781
It's for them.

4
00:22:18.157 --> 00:22:19.610
That's what's weak..

4
00:22:20.455 --> 00:22:21.631
Wow.

4
00:22:22.995 --> 00:22:24.778
You just wrinkled my brain, man.

4
00:22:24.779 --> 00:22:26.724
- He's good, isn't he?

4
00:22:26.725 --> 00:22:30.208
Shouldn't you be rolling around

4
00:22:33.664 --> 00:22:35.328
I don't have any

4
00:22:36.057 --> 00:22:37.866
I'm gonna--

4
00:22:37.867 --> 00:22:40.424
You just, like, study for, like, an hour.

4
00:22:40.648 --> 00:22:42.678
You seem pretty smart.

4
00:22:42.679 --> 00:22:43.829
I am me...

4
00:22:44.102 --> 00:22:45.620
Well, the funny thing

4
00:22:45.621 --> 00:22:48.571
is that you can get through most of life

4
00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:50.079
So, uh...

5
00:22:50.887 --> 00:22:52.868
I'm not really sure

5
00:22:58.295 --> 00:23:00.145
5
00:23:06.602 --> 00:23:08.286
Can you guys hear me?

5
00:23:08.287 --> 00:23:10.529
- Can you hear me talking right now?

5
00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:11.730
That's good.

5
00:23:13.905 --> 00:23:14.905
You know what?

5
00:23:14.906 --> 00:23:18.266
Jeff, actually, we didn't

5
00:23:18.267 --> 00:23:20.471
if you want

5
00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:24.672
Really?

5
00:23:25.056 --> 00:23:27.301
Well, it is your

5
00:23:27.391 --> 00:23:28.691
Come on, let's study.

5
00:23:28.782 --> 00:23:29.932
Sounds good.

5
00:23:30.145 --> 00:23:31.445
No pressure.

5
00:23:41.452 --> 00:23:44.439
I'm sorry I called you Michael Douglas

5
00:23:46.599 --> 00:23:49.899
Well, that's the nicest thing
